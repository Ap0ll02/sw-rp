Login script has to be completed since its not complete its causing TONS of errors

Also shepard and i have been thinking and want to get your say on this should we get rid of rifle xp pistol xp etc and just utilize combat levels
this would allow for us to code a lot faster but we wanted to go over it with you first.  
Without rifles and pistols to worry about it makes menus and such easier as well as your login script.
