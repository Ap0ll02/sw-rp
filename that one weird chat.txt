[DD]-Elegwa: Hello, thanks for letting me on the team
[SWO] Col. Shepard: im glad to have you
[DD]-Elegwa: Thanks
[SWO] Col. Shepard: ive desprately been needing a modeler
[DD]-Elegwa: Well, I'm here :D
[SWO] Col. Shepard: can you make v and w models for sweps including animations?
[DD]-Elegwa: No, I can make the weapons. I tried making v and w models once but the free modeling program I use doesnt let me do that, I may have to buy it so i can make the view correctly.
[DD]-Elegwa: As for animations, I could so those
[DD]-Elegwa: do*
[SWO] Col. Shepard: ok and what about fixing up a couple ragdolls we have, turning them around, tightening the joins, and adding animations to those so we can use them as player models?
[DD]-Elegwa: What kind of file is it?
[SWO] Col. Shepard: idk. i can give you the links to them
[SWO] Col. Shepard: we found these and wanted to use them for admin models but turns out they suck. we jsut need them fixed up
[DD]-Elegwa: Sweet, what else is there to do? Once I purchase the correct applcations this should go quick
[SWO] Col. Shepard: lots of weapons that we'll need
[DD]-Elegwa: Haha, thats what i hoped. I can list a lot of star wars weapons off the top of my head. By importance what do you need first?
[SWO] Col. Shepard: and along with the work ill be giving you, im sure mandalore has some too
[SWO] Col. Shepard: a blaster carbine (the ones stormtroopers use)
[DD]-Elegwa: Sweet, Well you can mail and so can Mandalore anything that you need made or fixed, If you list them by importance I'll know which ones to knock off first
[SWO] Col. Shepard: we have an svn
[SWO] Col. Shepard: let me see if mginshe is on. he can give you the svn info
