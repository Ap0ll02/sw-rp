___________________________________________________________________________________________________


...Because I thought we need one.

This will contain fully up to date information on the status, and progress of the gamemode, because everything has been a little bit sketchy up to now.

Also, with this document, new members of the team will very quickly and easily become familiar with the team and the project and can jump right in on features that haven't been started or finished.

NOTE: Anything which has been overlooked, PLEASE ADD TO IT. This needs to be a complete Manifesto of all the things to be included, otherwise it's pointless.
