Ok guys. 
There have been a few major changes in the last little while ( Appart from mandy handing leadershp over to Shep, and let me assure you, mandy is still verry much apart of SWO )
One of those changes has been the "management" system ( Thanks to iRzilla! =D )

This system involvs:
	Each different type of lua file ( Server, Client, and shared files ) has its own folder. Place all respective scripts in 	those folders ( They will automatically be included, and in the case of shared and client files, Downloaded )

	More organisation: No longer is the main folder spammed with 40+ files

	Overall betterness!

All i can think of at the moment, sorry
More updates soon
