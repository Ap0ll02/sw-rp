Try to code the profs as mentioned in specialization
if you can code some skills for them and possibly maybe a small hotbar that would be good for heals etc.
Keep in mind the game will be in first person though.
How ever you think their skills should be done ask Mandalore before coding the skills though.
If they specialize in something when using that weapon they do more damage each level and they do the most at level 50 obviously
They cannot use weapons that they do not specialize in.
Mandalore will code profs once iRzilla  finishes one prof so He can use it as an example.
