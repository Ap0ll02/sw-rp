Note set 1----

Writer: Shepard

Date: 5/28

Notes: I have just completed the first set of work. The files were made to resemble a blaster rifle with a green bolt. I still have no model for the gun and i have not tested it yet being that i am currently at school and i do not have garrysmod or steam installed on this computer and the school wifi is password protected. as soon as i get home i will transfer it to my desktop and test it. if all works out perfectly, i will upload to the svn tonite. currently the gun should also be useable by npcs and will be called blaster rifle: green. 
	Every gun that will be made will be cadagorized in 2 sections. the weapon type and the bullet color


Note set 2----

Notes: I am organizing all the guns' coding into separate folders based on gun type and color. oh and someone please get me a fucking player model of an old fasioned shotgun/rifle. the shotty crap I'm trying to turn into a civ gun is (like i said before) crap! it has a good W model but no v model. yes i know its exactly opposite of the lightsabers which is pissing me off. almost everything that we have decided to use contains either w model, v model, or no model and just uses the smg1/pistol model. none of the weapons i have worked on in the past week have had both V.mdl and w.mdl models (yes i need them in .mdl to work in the game and i also need animations) if you have any decent v models of an old fasioned shotgun please tell me. if you have any decent models that you want me to incorporate into the game as guns, they must have both V and w models and also be animated. oh and by the time beta comes around, we have to have some good models. i refuse to let any of my work be used publicly with smg1 or pistol models (i know im picky but hey, that pickieness is going to make sure the guns look good enough to impress the crowd)
